Note: I don't manage this code anymore, it's old and I'm not exactly proud of how I used to style code.  
The [Basic_Helpers](https://github.com/Theta-Z/Basic_Helpers) repository is a better example of the process and style I use now.

```c#
if(you agree to not sue me)  
{  
  if(you agree not to sue anyone I know)  
  {  
    if(you agree to give me credit if you use some of my code)  
    {  
      if(you agree to not harm me in any way)  
      {  
        you may browse my code freely.  
      }  
    }  
  }  
}  
```
if(you did not make the above if check) please leave.
